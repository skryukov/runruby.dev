[RunRuby.dev](https://runruby.dev) brings Ruby programming into your browser, streamlining the process of writing and running Ruby code. Here's what sets it apart:

- **Simple Editing**: Easily create, rename, and manage text files and directories directly in your browser.
- **Gist integration**: Save your work to a GitHub Gist and share it with others.
- **Bundler Support**: Add a `Gemfile` to your project and click "Bundle Install". The absence of native networking in WASI is not a problem.
- **Networking**: For networking, try using `Faraday` with the `Faraday::Adapter::JS` adapter to make web requests from Ruby.wasm.
- **Quick start**: Access gems or gists quickly with `runruby.dev/{gem_name}` and `runruby.dev/gist/{id}` URLs.
- **Gems Caching**: Take advantage of the browser's cache to prevent re-downloading gems, enhancing efficiency.

Built on top of [ruby.wasm](https://github.com/ruby/ruby.wasm) ðŸ’•.
